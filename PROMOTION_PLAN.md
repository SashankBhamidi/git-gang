# Git Gang Promotion Plan - Content & Distribution Only

## Phase 1: Content Creation (This Week)

### 1. Dev.to Article (Priority 1)
**Title**: "Building a Self-Merging PR System: GitHub Actions, Fork Permissions, and Auto-Merge"

**Structure**:
- The problem: Managing thousands of simple PRs manually is impossible
- The solution architecture:
  - `pull_request_target` for fork PR access
  - PAT_TOKEN vs GITHUB_TOKEN for different operations
  - Auto-merge workflow with validation gates
  - Template structure validation
  - Profanity filtering with fail-closed design
  - Post-merge processing with rollback
- Code snippets of key workflows
- Results: Fully automated end-to-end (15 seconds from PR to merge)
- CTA: "See it in action: add your name to the list"

**Tags**: #github #githubactions #automation #devops #cicd

**Why this works**: You're sharing real engineering solutions to real problems. The contributor list is just the demo.

### 2. Twitter/X Thread (Priority 2)
**Hook**: "Built a system that auto-merges PRs from forks without compromising security. Here's the architecture ðŸ§µ"

**Thread breakdown**:
1. Problem statement
2. Why `pull_request_target` matters for forks
3. Token strategy (PAT vs GITHUB_TOKEN)
4. Auto-merge implementation
5. Validation pipeline
6. Post-merge automation
7. "Try it yourself: [link]"
8. "Building in public. Started with 10, goal is 10K. RT if you found this useful!"

**Hashtags**: #BuildInPublic #GitHub #DevOps

### 3. Reddit Posts (Priority 3)

**r/github** - Technical focus
**Title**: "Built a fully automated PR processing system with auto-merge and fork permissions"
**Body**: Link to Dev.to article, technical summary, invite to test it out

**r/learnprogramming** - Different angle
**Title**: "Made a repo to practice making your first PR (no code required, fully automated)"
**Body**: Position as learning tool, 15 seconds, automated feedback

**r/opensource** - Community angle
**Title**: "Building the world's largest contributor list with GitHub Actions automation"
**Body**: Share the goal, the tech, current progress (10â†’10K), invite participation

## Phase 2: Directory Submissions (Week 2)

### 1. awesome-for-beginners
- Submit PR to add Git Gang
- Category: "Miscellaneous" or propose "First PR Practice"
- Highlight: No coding required, fully automated

### 2. up-for-grabs.net
- Submit project (requires `help wanted` label)
- Add label to repo if not present

### 3. goodfirstissue.dev
- Submit project listing
- Emphasize automation and beginner-friendly nature

### 4. firstcontributions/first-contributions
- Similar project (42K+ stars)
- Reach out for potential cross-promotion or collaboration

## Phase 3: Community Outreach (Week 2-3)

### 1. Discord Servers
Target servers with beginner developers:
- freeCodeCamp Discord
- The Odin Project Discord
- 100Devs Discord
- Post in appropriate channels: "Built a repo to practice PRs"

### 2. Hashnode
- Cross-post Dev.to article
- Join GitHub and Open Source communities
- Share in relevant discussions

### 3. Dev.to Engagement
- Share article in relevant communities
- Engage with related posts (add value + link when relevant)

## Phase 4: Ongoing Growth Tactics

### 1. Milestone Marketing
When you hit numbers, make noise:
- 50 contributors: Twitter announcement
- 100 contributors: Blog post "0 to 100 in X days"
- 500 contributors: Case study on the automation
- 1000 contributors: Video breakdown + stats

### 2. Building in Public
Regular updates on Twitter:
- "Day X: Y contributors, Z from A countries"
- Share interesting contributions/messages
- Technical improvements/learnings
- Challenges faced

### 3. Contributor Spotlights
Weekly/bi-weekly:
- Feature random contributor
- Quote their message, tag them
- "This week's contributor: @username"
- They RT â†’ their network sees it

## The Strategy

**Lead with the tech, not the count.**
- You built impressive automation
- The contributor list is proof it works
- Share engineering insights, developers will engage
- Natural CTAs: "Try it yourself"
- Document the journey: 10 â†’ 100 â†’ 1,000 â†’ 10,000

**Don't:**
- Spam links without context
- Over-claim before earning it
- Hide current numbers (be transparent)

**Do:**
- Share technical learnings
- Build in public narrative
- Make it easy to participate
- Celebrate milestones authentically
